	<p>In 1693, the three Sanderson sisters: Winifred, Mary and Sarah, were sentenced to death for witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts. After being discovered using witchery to suck the life out of Emily Binx, a young farmgirl, the sisters were hung outside of their cottage in the woods. Only seconds before their death, Winifred, the oldest and wisest of the three sisters, layed a curse; a curse that said when a black flame candle was lit on Halloween night, herself and her sisters would return. Fast forward to Salem in 1993, where teenage Max Dennison, accompanied by his crush Allison and younger sister Dani, venture to the now historic landmark Sanderson Sister Cottage for a little Halloween fun. In a failed attempt to impress his crush, Max lights the black flame candle, bringing Winifred, Mary and Sarah back to life. Now, after 300 years, Sanderson sisters are back and it's up to Max, Allison and little Dani to stop them from terrorizing Salem. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107120/" target="_blank">click to see imdb review</a></p>
